From prepping the equipment to packing down the set at the end of the day, every step was crucial to ensuring the shoot went smoothly. Here’s a behind-the-scenes look at how I navigated the first shoot of my career with the Main Media Team.A successful shoot starts long before the cameras roll.

Clearing any cards, cleaning camera lenses and sourcing any other miscellaneous equipment. With everything in place, the equipment was carefully packed into the car ready for the long journey to Rochdale.While the journey itself was smooth, we were mindful of any traffic delays and made sure to leave early enough to account for any unforeseen delays. Once arrived at the hotel I had booked two weeks prior, we unloaded the equipment in our rooms and had an early night! ",
